The update-ca-certificates utility in Debian manages the system's trust store, but you must place the CA file in the correct location first.

Run these commands on your Debian client machine:

Bash

# 1. Create a logical directory for your CA (optional, but good practice)
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/synthrealm

# 2. Copy the CA certificate into the directory, ensuring it has the .crt extension
sudo cp CA-Synthrealm.net.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/synthrealm/synthrealm-ca.crt

# 3. Update the system trust store
# This command reads the file, converts it, and creates the necessary links
sudo update-ca-certificates
Verification: You should see output similar to this:

Updating certificates in /etc/ssl/certs...
1 added, 0 removed; done.
Running hooks in /etc/ca-certificates/update.d...
done.
This confirms that the operating system now trusts any certificate (like your Kanidm server's) signed by your CA-Synthrealm.net.
